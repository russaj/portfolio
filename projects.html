    <h2>PlantShopper App</h2>
    <center><i>September - December, 2019 | UX Research, UX Design</center></i><br><br>
    <p>For my Interaction Design (SI 582) course, I participated in a semester-long project with the goal of going through every phase of the product design process, from ideation through prototyping. In the end, I created PlantShopper - an app that can be used to find vegan products in supermarkets.</p><br>
    <div class = "plantshopper"></div><br><br>
    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>The first step of the process was to identify a list of problems that I wanted to solve, ultimately landing on one problem that could be synthesized into a clear goal. 
    <br><br>
    As a vegan for many years, it has been hard to purchase foods - especially processed foods - in the supermarket because there are many animal by-product ingredients with long names that I just don’t understand or know (such as casein, gelatin, isinglass, L. Cysteine, etc.). While the ‘vegan’ icon exists on many products, it does not exist on all even though some products may be vegan (did you know Oreos were vegan?). There are many vegan apps on the market such as Happy Cow to find vegan and vegetarian friendly restaurants, but the apps to find vegan products are few and have some major challenges such as an ineffective user interface or inaccurate information.
    <br><br>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th class="colhead">Big Problem</th>
          <th class="colhead">Goal</th>
          <th class="colhead">Tool</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>There are disparate apps for vegans to easily live their chosen lifestyle, and no good tool currently exists to identify if a product on the shelf is vegan (there are a lot of sneaky animal byproduct ingredients out there).</td>
          <td>To provide information to vegans on what products are truly vegan and how they can be used to cook meals that meet their specific lifestyle.</td>
          <td>An app that can be used to understand if items on the shelf at the grocery store are vegan, what their ratings by other vegans are, and what recipes can be used with this product.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <h3>Needfinding Interviews</h3>
    <p>I conducted a combination of in-person and digital surveys to reach the vegan community and understand their major challenges. After identifying demographics such as name, age group, professional status, vegan status - I asked the following questions:</p>
        <ul class="list"><li>What is the hardest part about being vegan?</li>
        <li>How do you get information on vegan foods?</li>
        <li>What challenges do you face when eating out?</li>
        <li>What challenges do you face when grocery shopping?</li></ul>
    <p>While these interviews did corroborate my initially identified problem, I realized there were also a handful of other challenges that could also be tackled with this app. Vegans did not feel like they had a community - people to share recipes, to share feedback on products. </p>
    <h3>Sketching and Scenarios</h3>
    <p>Now with more of an idea of what issues vegan users had in their daily life, I went to the drawing board (or sketch book, if you will) to try to see what this app would look like and how a scenario would play out.
    <br><br>
    <b>The Scenario:</b> Lindsey, a vegan, is doing her weekly grocery shopping at her neighborhood grocery store. She pulls her phone out of her purse as she walks towards the grocery store to see what she needs to buy on this visit. She also opens her Vegan Scan app which can scan products and then search all the ingredients associated with the barcode to see if the product is vegan or not. The app will then clearly indicate whether the product is vegan or not.
    <br><br>
    As Lindsey walks into the store she begins to do her normal grocery shopping, but today she also goes down the snack aisle. She has a movie night with friends coming up and needs to buy some yummy snacks – but also snacks that are vegan. She goes down the aisle and when she spots an item she thinks could be vegan she puts her phone to the item’s barcode to scan to see if it’s vegan or not. While it does require some work – not all items are vegan and she has to scan a lot of items – it’s much easier than looking at all the ingredients – many of which she can’t even pronounce let alone know what it is. After 15 minutes in the snack aisle, she has everything she needs for the upcoming movie night and she’s ready to check out. She knows that the processed snack foods in her cart are vegan so she can enjoy the snack foods as much as her friends will at her upcoming movie night.
    <h3>User Flow</h3>
    <p>Now that I had a general idea of what users would want from PlantShopper, I needed to think through how the different pages and features of the app would all be connected. How would a user get from the home page to the product scanner? What other decisions needed to be made along the way? This was a necessary step to detail how the app would work that would be very beneficial for the paper and digital prototypes.</p>
    <div class="flip-card">
      <div class="flip-card-inner">
        <div class="flip-card-front">
          <img id="userflow" src="images/userflow.png" alt="plantshopper user flow"/>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This flow shows all the steps the user can take within PlantShopper, and while not easy to read it shows the thought process that went behind all of the app pages and how they are all linked together to create the user experience.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3>Prototyping</h3>
    <p>A paper prototype was created for initial user testing where the testers were given three tasks to perform with the paper prototype and offer feedback. The digital prototype was then created in Adobe XD from this information and further user testing was conducted to perform the same tasks to determine any problem areas.</p>

    <h3>Learnings</h3>
    <p>This semester-long project taught me how important user research and user testing are to creating a successful product. The initial idea I had for PlantShopper completely evolved based on what I discovered vegans actually needed and my initial designs changed when users had trouble understanding how to perform certain tasks. </p>
    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
    <p>I would like to continue work on this project, and some of the next steps are as follows:</p>
      <ul class = "list">
        <li>Conduct usability tests with the digital prototype</li>
        <li>Conduct more user interviews to make any feature enhancements</li>
        <li>Work with a developer to build out the app and integrate relevant data needed for identifying vegan foods based off bar codes</li>
        <li>Conduct field tests with the app</li>
      </ul>
