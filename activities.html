    <h2>Tech Club</h2>
    <div class="activity"> 
      <p>Almost as soon as I began my MBA journey at Ross I knew I wanted to be part of the <a href="https://ross.campusgroups.com/rtc/home/">Tech Club</a>. As a first year MBA, I was selected to plan our first ever Tech Day - an all day event where we put together panels of leading technologists from around the country and also workshops that prepared MBA students for upcoming interviews. I was then selected to serve as the President. With this role, I oversaw 34 board members making up 8 teams. During my tenure as President:</p>
      <div class="list">
        &#8226; We had <b>19 events</b> (outside of Tech Week) with over <b>650 participants</b> (thanks to those who came to multiple events!)<br><br>
        &#8226; We planned a Tech Trek to the West Coast, allowing <b>86 students</b> to meet 18 companies during Fall Break in the Bay Area and Seattle<br><br>
        &#8226; We held our first ever <a href="https://ross.campusgroups.com/rtc/tech-week/">Tech Week</a>, consisting of four events during the week where we partnered with other Ross Clubs and had over 175 participants<br><br>
        &#8226; We had 5 company sponsors for Tech Week, allowing us to have t-shirts and catered events throughout the week<br><br>
        &#8226; We also held our second annual Tech Day, where 5 alumni came to be on a fireside chat or panel for the morning portion and where 90 MBA1s participated in mock interviews with alumni and MBA2s in the afternoon

          <p>Story Lab is a collaboration between the <a href = "https://sanger.umich.edu/">Sanger Leadership Center</a> and the <a href = "https://ross.campusgroups.com/designplusbusiness/home/">Design+Business Club</a>. We put on four showcases each year where student speakers share their personal stories on stage in front of their peers and the larger Ross community. These speakers also attended one of two workshops we put together each where where we bring professional communication consultants <a href ="http://www.wolfandheron.com/">wolf&herron</a> to campus to go through a five hour workshop on how to be effective story tellers. </p>

    <h2>Traveling</h2>
    <div class="activity"> 
          <p>Through the Ross Business School, I have been able to travel all over the world! As an incoming student, I travled to Chile for M-Trek and then lead an M-Trek the next year to New Zealand. I also particpiated in J-Trek, where Japanese MBA students showed us their home country. For MAP, I had a life-changing experience where I worked with an Indian company to help them make an impact for women in rural villages in Southern India.</p>
