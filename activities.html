      <p>Almost as soon as I began my MBA journey at Ross I knew I wanted to be part of the Tech Club. As a first year MBA, I was selected to plan our first ever Tech Day - an all day event where we put together panels of leading technologists from around the country and also workshops that prepared MBA students for upcoming interviews. I was then selected to serve as the President. With this role, I oversaw 34 board members making up 8 teams. During my tenure as President:</p>
      <ul class="list"><li>We had <b>19 events</b> (outside of Tech Week) with over <b>650 participants</b> (thanks to those who came to multiple events!)</li>
      <li>We planned a Tech Trek to the West Coast, allowing <b>86 students</b> to meet 18 companies during Fall Break in the Bay Area and Seattle</li>
      <li>We held our first ever <a href="https://ross.campusgroups.com/rtc/tech-week/">Tech Week</a>, consisting of four events during the week where we partnered with other Ross Clubs and had over 175 participants</li>
      <li>We had 5 company sponsors for Tech Week, allowing us to have t-shirts and catered events throughout the week</li>
      <li>We also held our second annual Tech Day, where 5 alumni came to be on a fireside chat or panel for the morning portion and where 90 MBA1s participated in mock interviews with alumni and MBA2s in the afternoon</li></ul>
