    <h1 class="about" id="about">About Me</h1>
    <div>
    <p>I am a masters student studying business and user experience design. I graduated from Indiana University in 2014 where she majored in Marketing, Supply Chain Management, and Technology Management. After undergrad, I worked as a technology consultant for Deloitte Consulting, and this past summer I was the Data Analyst intern at CVS Health. At school I am involved with the <a href="https://ross.campusgroups.com/rtc/home/">Ross Tech Club</a>, <a href="https://ross.campusgroups.com/designplusbusiness/home/">Design + Business Club - Story Lab</a>, and <a href="https://ross.campusgroups.com/rossofb/home/">Ross Out for Business Club</a>. Based on my experience and interests, I aim to bridge the gap between front end designers / researchers and back end data strategists.</p>
    <br>
    <p>As an only child, I often had to find ways to entertain myself. From creating games to writing stories to putting on neighborhood carnivals, I was always trying to create something new. As I moved onto college and my professional career in technology consulting, I built out my analytical thinking and communication skills but never lost that drive to create. This led me to enroll in the School of Information Masters in User Experience Design program after initially enrolling in the Ross School of Business MBA program. As a dual degree student, I will have the skillset and experiences to create products on the front end and the back end.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In my spare time, I love to travel. My favorite travel destination is Greece, where I have visited three times. I event spent a summer at an archaeological dig on the island of Patmos during undergrad. I also love to get lost in a good book and snuggle with my two cats (Hazelnut and Dax). </p>
